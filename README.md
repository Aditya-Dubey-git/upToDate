## To-Do List Application

This is a basic to-do list web application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js (Express).
As I continue learning, I plan to enhance this project by adding more functionalities, including using React for the front end.


## Features:

-Add tasks to the to-do list.

-Mark tasks as completed or edit it as per need.

-Delete tasks from the list.


##Technologies Used:

-HTML: For structuring the content.

-CSS: For styling the application.

-JavaScript: For handling the client-side logic.

-Node.js (Express): For handling the server-side functionality.
